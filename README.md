## Tech Strack Used
* Azure Data Factory: Orchestrating data workflows seamlessly.
* Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2: Efficient and scalable data storage solution.
* Azure Databricks: Transforming raw data into a refined state.
* Azure Synapse Analytics: Loading clean data for advanced analytics.
* Azure Key Vault: Ensuring secure storage and management of sensitive information.
* Azure Active Directory (AAD): Facilitating authentication and access management.
* Microsoft Power BI: Building interactive dashboards for data visualization.

## Use Case:
* Data Ingestion:
  - Tables from on-premise SQL Server database ingested using Azure Data Factory.

* Data Transformation:
  - Azure Databricks employed to transform raw data into a pristine state.

* Data Loading:
  - Utilizing Azure Synapse Analytics to load the cleaned data efficiently.
  
* Reporting:
  - Microsoft Power BI integrated with Azure Synapse Analytics to create interactive dashboards.

  
## Additional Tools for Governance:
* Azure Active Directory (AAD):
  - Implemented for enhanced monitoring and access control.
  
* Azure Key Vault:
  - Safeguarding sensitive information with secure storage and management.

  
# Achievements:
* Creation of a complete end-to-end data platform.
* Seamless integration of Azure services for efficient data handling.
* Implementation of governance tools for monitoring and security.


## Project Impact:
* Empowering users with a fully functional data platform that covers every aspect of data management, from ingestion to visualization.
